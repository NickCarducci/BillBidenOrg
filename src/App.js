          Biden only thinks the state will prosecute Cuomo if he raped somebody,
          not if he followed the NYC DOH orders [to not be able to deny entry
          into nursing home by 1/2000/yr antigen test, only symptom], the whole
          of government is liable then
          <br />
          <br />
          You need to snip him. Cuomo should be impeached for being so stupid as
          to not allowing DOH to prevent symptomatic people; Clinton should be
          impeached for removing Glass-steagal.
