        You can tax sales (of end-products, not equity) for free-rider-immutable
        services, wealth for systematic reparations but really those are torts,
        and adjunicate torts to repair unjustice; any tax or debt otherwise not
        only is involuntary slavery and a trust-building monopsony by the
        government, their contractors and their propograndising conspitators in
        ratings and education, but debt benefits the bond-holders & interference
        by tax or credit does nothing for the state of the world or the
        utilities purchased but raise prices and circumvent Savers who have
        worked for what they earn. SaverParty.xyz represents the people that
        work or fund entrepreneurs on their customers' time, and do not borrow
        or lend, and it is good for quality + -price. It is an obvious
        red-herring to help Wall st; yet the Republicans do the same. Saver
        party exists and represents most Americans. Why call your parties one of
        the primary two; bipartisanship representing a minority of Americans -
        and no civil or human rights - is a lie, if claiming it to be what
        people want - or deserve.
